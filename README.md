# Gender Detection Using Deep Learning

This project implements real-time gender detection using computer vision techniques and deep learning. A pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to classify a person's gender (Male or Female) based on facial features extracted from input images or webcam streams.


## Features

- Detects human faces in real-time using OpenCV's DNN face detector
- Classifies gender using a pre-trained Caffe deep learning model


- Displays the predicted gender label over each detected face


- Works on live video streams from a webcam


## Installation

Install Install the necessary Python libraries

```bash
  pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python numpy

```
